# Next.js 13+ Page Location Warning

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when migrating to Next.js 13 and above: the deprecation of the `pages` directory as the default location for pages.

## Problem

In Next.js versions 13 and higher, the `pages` directory is no longer the standard place to put page components. Using it will result in a warning and potential deployment issues.

The provided `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  It attempts to render a page from the `pages` directory which results in a warning from the Next.js compiler.

## Solution

The solution is to refactor your project. The suggested solution is to migrate the page components to the `app` directory (Next.js's new routing structure).  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected approach.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` (This will trigger Next.js to show the warning).
4. Observe the warning message in your terminal.  The solution will fix this warning.

## Note:

If, due to legacy reasons, you must use the `pages` directory (not recommended), you may need to adjust your `next.config.js` file accordingly and leverage the `next export` functionality.  This is, however, not the standard approach for Next.js 13+.
